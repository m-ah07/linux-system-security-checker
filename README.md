# 🛡️ Linux System Security Checker

A lightweight and powerful **Bash script** designed to perform a quick security audit of your Linux system. This tool checks for firewall status, sensitive file permissions, inactive users, running services, and available updates, then generates a detailed security report in both text and HTML formats.


## 🚀 Features
- 🔥 **Firewall Status**: Checks if UFW is active and lists current rules.
- 🔐 **Sensitive File Permissions**: Verifies permissions for critical files like `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, and `/etc/hosts`.
- 👤 **Inactive User Accounts**: Detects unused or suspicious accounts based on login shells.
- 🛠️ **Service Monitoring**: Lists top 10 running services by memory usage.
- ⬆️ **System Updates**: Checks for available package updates to keep your system secure.
- 📄 **Detailed Report**: Automatically generates a comprehensive security report in both **text** and **HTML** formats for better visualization.
